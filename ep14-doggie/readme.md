# ep14 - explosions

## Objectives
- learn about making explosions
- learn about using the `pal()` function

## Challenge 1

## Challenge 2

## Challenge 3

## Notes
- "An explosion must always been bigger than the thing it explodes" important axiom
- maybe next episode, is make explosions procedurally - since, when we create explosions manually in the spritesheet with a sprite index array and manual sprite choices in that array, it takes up a lot of space, tokens, and time/effort
